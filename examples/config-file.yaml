# Example configuration for reading from a local file
#
# This configuration reads registry data from a local JSON file on the filesystem.
# This is useful for:
#   - Testing and development
#   - Reading from mounted volumes (e.g., ConfigMaps mounted as files)
#   - Pre-downloaded or statically provided registry data
#
# Usage:
#   thv-registry-api serve --config examples/config-file.yaml

# Registry name/identifier (optional, defaults to "default")
registryName: toolhive

# Data source configuration
source:
  # Source type: file, git, configmap, or api
  type: file

  # Data format: toolhive (native) or upstream (MCP registry format)
  format: toolhive

  # Local file configuration
  file:
    # Path to the registry.json file (absolute or relative)
    # Can be a mounted ConfigMap, downloaded file, or any JSON file
    path: ./data/registry.json

# Automatic synchronization policy
syncPolicy:
  # Sync interval - how often to check if the file has changed
  # For local files, you can use shorter intervals
  interval: "5m"

# Optional: Filter configuration to include/exclude specific servers
# filter:
#   # Name-based filtering
#   names:
#     include:
#       - "official/*"
#       - "stacklok/*"
#     exclude:
#       - "*/deprecated"
#
#   # Tag-based filtering
#   tags:
#     include:
#       - "production"
#       - "stable"
#     exclude:
#       - "experimental"
